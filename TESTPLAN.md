# Test Plan for Marketing Campaign Scheduling Feature

## Feature Description
The Marketing Campaign Scheduling feature allows users to schedule email campaigns to be sent at specific dates and times (in UTC). Users can configure various parameters for their campaigns, such as selecting the recipient list and specifying the email template. The feature ensures that campaigns are sent out accurately and can handle large volumes of emails efficiently.
